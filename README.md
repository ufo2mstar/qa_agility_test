# Test Tutotial Topics
Hey Pawan!  
For web apps in general, I feel that knowledge in these topics may be the most useful to have
I am not sure what the time and resource constraints are, but here is my opinion..  
## Common Knowledge
for anyone looking into Automation in general (at leasst to brush up on if they already know these)
 1. Web app overview _at the heighest level possible_
	 - code (program)
	 - server
	 - browser
 2. UI - where the user comes in
    - HTML / CSS / JS
 3. Javascript - where the magic happens  
   
----------


 ## TDD - BDD - DDT
 1. ideology
 2. industry practices
 3. Build Automation
 4. Test Automation
    - levels of test
	    - micro (unit)
	    - mid range (Integration)
	    - macro (end2end)
    - regression (CI)
 6. tools  
 **the rest is after the programming stuff**

 ## Programming (with Classes and what not)
A better way to call Object Oriented Programming
1. data
2. types (also called `datatypes`)
	- primitive
	- derived
7. variables
8. operators
9. functions
10. classes
	- and inheritance
11. objects
12. how it all works together
	* starting (compiling and stuff, if applicable)
	* `main()`
	* programming constructs
		* blocks
		* loops
		* cases
		* Error/Exceptions

## Java  

1. inheritance
2. interfaces - setting hard patterns and templates
3. `@annotations`
4. `javac`
5. how it all works together
6. other tools if necessary..
   - jars
 	- jsp (or other templating languages)
	- spring (or similar power tools and libraries)
    
    
### testing in java
1. unit testing - JUnit
2.	test setup
10.	class naming
11.	invoking test
12.	result review
----------
## Ruby
> ust laying it simple here..  
will go deeper, depending on what is covered in *__Java__*
1. why Ruby? (and why Dynamically Typed Languages are better suited for this kinda job)
2. __syntactic sugars__ and other easy ways to write more _human readable_ code
3. similarities and differences to Statically Typed Languages
4. `gems`
5. other tools
   - tools like RSpec, Rake etc

## Cucumber  

1. gherkin
	1. Feature: title
	2. Scenario:
	3. Scenario Outline:
	4. Examples:
	5. `@tags`
	6. Background
	7. Comments
		- \#
		- \" " "
	8. Documentation  
2. steps
3. step definitions
4. hooks
5. test Framework
	1. data management
	2. support libraries
	3. running conditionals
	4. error raising
